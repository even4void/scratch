Trying out to run some Stata code:

```{wolfram}
data = {7.05, 2.49, 16.09, 21.3, 19.21, 14.88, 16.41, 0.19, 9.71,
  10.18, 8.81, 2.93, 18.11, 22.2, 9.79, 14.74, 4.54, 16.76, 8.46,
  24.9};
skews = Table[Skewness[RandomChoice[data, Length[data]]], {1000}];
Quantile[skews, {.025, .975}]
```

That's it!
