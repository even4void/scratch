# Python 3.x only considers long integers, which together with dynamic typing
# helps to avoid integer overflow or cast errors.
print(sys.maxsize)

# Modular arithmetic is easy too, e.g. n! modulo m.
x = 1
n, m = 15, 2
r = [(x * i) % m for i in range(2, n)]

# Python handles printing of floating-point arithmetic well enough; see, e.g.,
# "Printing Floating-Point Numbers Quickly and Accurately with Integers". However,
# we can always ask for more.
# See also, https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html.
x = 0.3 * 3 + 0.1
print(x)  ## old Python 2.x would be "%.20f" % x
format(x, ".20f")  ## Python 3.x comes with f-strings: "{:.20f}".format(x)

# To compare floats, it is still possible to mimic C/C++ (f)abs, but PEP485
# introduced handy functions for that matter.

# Arithmetic and geometric series are more interesting patterns since we can
# rely on generators or the itertools module. See, e.g., this thread on SO:
